Enigma Freelancer project is based on improving human resource recruitment (HRR)
process and work-life balance concept in developing countries. HRR process and work-life
balance concept is not hardly integrated in developing countries. Human resource
management is simply helping both the employee and employer to achieve their goals. In
this competitive business world, it is very important for employer to recruit the right
person to the right place at the right time.
In human resource functions, Recruitment is the most critical and time-consuming
process. We can see that lots of E-Systems, web sites and other e solutions are designing
to ease this process as example in Sri Lanka we can see top jobs, rakiya.lk, jobak.lk, wow.lk
and many sites that provide these services. But none of these platforms didn’t address
following issues of the employers and the employees as job seekers face. Main issues we
see when integrating work-life balance concept into recruitment process are as follows,
− Existing relevant platforms only capable of posting job advertisement and let
applicant to apply through that and they only support for finding permeant jobs
− Existing freelancing platforms does not facilitate local service requirements for
local users (Sri Lankan)
− We found out that there are no platforms for employers to find the persons that
match with their requirement directly without posting an advertisement
− There are no E- platform to support their succession planning in the organization
to find their next successors externally
− Inability to balance the speed of recruitment process with the quality of hiring.
When employers get sudden vacant position, to fill that position the quality
recruitment processes usually take times
− Ineffectiveness in recruitment process. Normally organizations spend lots of time
in their recruitment process for shortlisting, screening, interviewing and other
administrative process. And they again repeating the same process even for the
same position.
− The lack of ways to find a job for employees nearby their residence. Because as a
third world country we can see that lots of people struggling with our poor
transport systems.

We introduce a new way to get any tasks done in Sri lank and internationally, anytime,
anywhere. we are introducing a website and mobile platform for eliminating borders and
obstacles for skilled persons in various businesses to find or get hired by required persons
on demand while optimizing the competitiveness and flexibility for skilled persons and
hiring person. This platform will give the employers and employees the ability to filter out
the demand in certain geographical area which will give more opportunity for nearest
users to get hired or find jobs. Also provide the feature of maintaining good professional
profile to get more opportunists. Which will help to employer to check employee previous
work comments, review as deciding factor to decide whether to hire or not.
